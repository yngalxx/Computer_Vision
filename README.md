# Computer Vision projects
This folder contains my computer vision projects, created for fun and learning.
I am trying to understand how to deal with neural networks in case of computer vision and everything other related to computer vision in Python such as OpenCV library. 

### Cats_and_dogs:
First attempt to build CNN on date from kaggle dataset containing pictures of cats and dogs. Notebook inside includes my full approach with some theoretical descriptions and urls to information sources * Notebook still under construction * ;)
