# Computer Vision projects
This folder contains my computer vision projects, created for fun and learning. 
I am trying to understand how to deal with neural networks, what they really are and how they work. 
To be honest, this is my initial step in the journey of understanding Deep Learning methods, not counting a few attempts, created just for fun.
